## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Industry Benchmarks
**Normal Operating Ranges (From Repository Data):**
- **Near-Miss Reporting Rate:** Establish industry average from USAFacts data
- **Rework Percentage:** Identify typical rework rates in engineering from BLS data
- **Project Failure Rate:** Determine average failure rates from JMU industry reports
- **Communication Openness Score:** Benchmark from World Bank organizational effectiveness data

#### Performance Comparison
**Benchmark Comparisons:**
- Compare organizational reporting rates to industry averages (identify underreporting)
- Compare rework costs to industry benchmarks (quantify impact severity)
- Compare decision quality indicators to international standards (assess relative performance)

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators (X: Low Psychological Safety)
**Data confirming problem exists:**
1. **Low reporting rates:** If organizational/industry near-miss reporting is below benchmark, indicates psychological safety problem
2. **Communication barriers:** World Bank data showing organizational communication effectiveness gaps
3. **Culture scores:** Industry reports showing low psychological safety scores in engineering contexts

#### Problem Severity Measurement (Y: Costs and Impact)
**Quantifying severity:**

2. **Rework burden:** BLS productivity data → percentage of work hours devoted to preventable rework
3. **Project failure frequency:** JMU case studies → rate of project failures attributable to communication/decision issues

#### Root Cause Investigation (M: Information Bottlenecks)

- Note any discrepancies or inconsistencies

### Version Control
**Managing data versions:**
- Record dataset publication dates
- Note any data revisions or updates
- Maintain original downloaded files with date stamps
- Document which version of data used in analysis

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
**Potential gaps:**
- "Decision quality" as specific construct may not be directly measured in most repositories
- Psychological safety organizational-level data may be limited (more common at individual/team level in academic research)
- Industry-specific engineering data may be sparse in some repositories
- Proprietary organizational data (ideal) not accessible through public repositories

### Data Quality Issues
**Potential problems:**
- Aggregation levels may not match desired analysis (country-level vs. industry-level vs. organization-level)
- Inconsistent definitions across repositories (e.g., "rework" defined differently)
- Self-reported organizational data may have social desirability bias
- Temporal gaps in data coverage

### Access Barriers
**Potential obstacles:**
- Some JMU Library databases may require special access or have limited availability
- International data (World Bank) may not include sufficient U.S.-specific detail
- Industry reports may be summarized rather than providing raw data
- Historical data limitations (some metrics not tracked before certain dates)

### Time Constraints
**Impact on data collection:**
- Repository searches time-intensive (multiple platforms, different interfaces)
- Data extraction and cleaning requires significant effort
- Learning repository-specific tools and interfaces takes time
- Limited time for comprehensive analysis of all available datasets

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
**If primary repositories insufficient:**
1. **Academic literature:** Use scientific studies that report organizational-level secondary data
2. **Practitioner reports:** Rely more heavily on Google/McKinsey/HBR organizational case studies
3. **Government regulatory data:** OSHA, FDA, or other regulatory agency databases with relevant organizational metrics
4. **Industry associations:** Engineering professional associations may publish relevant benchmark data

### Proxy Measures
**Substitute metrics if ideal data unavailable:**
1. **For psychological safety (X):** Use workplace safety culture scores as proxy; use error reporting rates
2. **For information sharing (M):** Use communication frequency data; use idea submission rates
3. **For decision quality (Y):** Use broader "team performance" or "project success" as proxy; use rework rates; use cost overruns

### Simplified Analysis
**Minimum viable organizational evidence:**
1. **One strong dataset per construct:** At least one credible organizational dataset for X, M, and Y
2. **Industry benchmarking:** Sufficient data to establish "normal" vs. "problem" performance levels
3. **Cost quantification:** At least rough estimate of financial impact ($500K+ claim)
4. **Mechanism validation:** Evidence that information bottlenecks (M) link X and Y

## Why These Repositories Matter

### Organizational-Level Evidence Advantages
**Value of repository data:**
1. **Macro-level validation:** Shows X→Y relationship exists at organizational/industry scale, not just in controlled studies
2. **Financial quantification:** Provides real-world cost data for decision failures
3. **Benchmarking capability:** Allows comparison of organizational performance to industry standards
4. **Trend identification:** Historical data reveals whether problem is worsening, stable, or improving
5. **Generalizability:** Cross-industry and international data increases confidence in broad applicability

### Support for X→M→Y Logic Model

#### X (Psychological Safety):
**How datasets support:**
- **USAFacts:** Low reporting rates indicate low psychological safety to speak up
- **World Bank:** Organizational culture indicators measure communication openness
- **JMU Reports:** Case studies document psychological safety problems in engineering failures

#### M (Information Sharing Mechanisms):
**How datasets support:**
- **USAFacts:** Reporting frequency directly measures information sharing behavior
- **JMU Reports:** Root cause analyses show information bottlenecks as failure mechanism
- **World Bank:** Communication effectiveness metrics capture information flow quality

#### Y (Decision Quality Outcomes):
**How datasets support:**
- **BLS:** Rework rates and error costs quantify poor decision outcomes
- **JMU Reports:** Project failure data links communication problems to decision failures
- **World Bank:** Decision-making quality indicators directly measure outcome of interest
- **Cost estimates:** $500K+ annual impact claim grounded in BLS productivity and JMU cost data

### Strengthening Causal Confidence
**Organizational evidence contributions:**
1. **Triangulation:** Repository data triangulates with scientific and practitioner evidence
2. **Real-world validation:** Shows X→Y relationship exists in actual organizations, not just experiments
3. **Scale demonstration:** Industry-level data shows problem magnitude and prevalence
4. **Mechanism evidence:** Root cause analyses validate M (information bottlenecks) as linking mechanism
5. **Cost justification:** Financial data justifies solution investment ($500K+ impact supports intervention ROI)
