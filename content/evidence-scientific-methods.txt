## Studies Selected for Evidence Base

### Final Selection: 2 High-Quality Studies

#### Study 1: Frazier et al. (2017) - Meta-Analysis
**Full Citation:** [To be completed in sources file]
**Type:** Systematic meta-analysis
**Focus:** Psychological safety → performance outcomes
**Key Contribution:** Comprehensive quantitative synthesis showing robust positive relationship between psychological safety and multiple performance indicators
**Relevance:** Directly addresses X→Y relationship with large aggregated effect sizes

#### Study 2: Detert & Burris (2007) - Field Study
**Full Citation:** [To be completed in sources file]
**Type:** Longitudinal multi-source field study
**Focus:** Employee voice → unit-level decision quality
**Key Contribution:** Rare direct measurement of decision quality as outcome; demonstrates that voice behavior (mechanism of psychological safety) improves managerial decision-making
**Relevance:** Provides specific evidence for psychological safety mechanism (voice) → decision quality outcome

### Rationale for Two-Study Selection
**Why only 2 studies selected:**
1. **Quality over quantity:** Both studies are high-impact publications in top-tier journals
2. **Comprehensive coverage:** Meta-analysis provides broad synthesis; field study provides specific mechanism evidence
3. **Effect size reporting:** Both clearly report quantitative effect sizes needed for evidence synthesis
4. **Direct relevance:** Both studies directly address X→Y relationship central to hypothesis
5. **Resource constraints:** Graduate-level research focuses on depth of analysis over breadth of literature review

## Challenges and Limitations

### Search Limitations
**Access Constraints:**
- Some potentially relevant studies behind paywalls not accessible through JMU Library
- International journals in organizational behavior not always available in full text
- Older studies (pre-2000) less accessible digitally

**Topic-Specific Challenges:**
- "Decision quality" as explicit outcome is rare; most studies focus on broader "team performance"
- Limited experimental/intervention studies in organizational settings (ethical/practical constraints)
- Psychological safety research is relatively recent (post-1999), limiting historical depth

### Resource Constraints
**Time Limitations:**
- Graduate coursework timeline requires focused selection rather than exhaustive systematic review
- Prioritized highest-quality studies over comprehensive literature coverage

**Database Access:**
- Relied primarily on JMU Library resources
- Some specialized organizational behavior databases not available

### Methodological Challenges
**Study Design Limitations in Literature:**
- Few true experimental studies of psychological safety interventions (most are correlational/observational)
- Causal inference limited by predominance of cross-sectional designs
- Limited studies directly measuring "decision quality" as distinct from general performance

**Generalizability Concerns:**
- Most studies from Western organizational contexts (U.S., Europe)
- Limited research in small/medium enterprises (emphasis on larger organizations)
- Engineering/tech team contexts underrepresented in academic literature

## Implications for Evidence Quality

### Strengths of Selected Evidence Base
1. **High methodological quality:** Meta-analysis + field study from top journals
2. **Clear effect size reporting:** Quantitative evidence for X→Y relationship
3. **Multi-level analysis:** Individual (voice) and team (psychological safety) levels
4. **Temporal design:** Detert & Burris includes longitudinal component

### Acknowledged Limitations
1. **Small number of studies:** 2 studies provide focused evidence, not comprehensive review
2. **Causality constraints:** Primarily correlational evidence; limited experimental manipulation
3. **Outcome specificity:** "Decision quality" less commonly measured than general performance
4. **Context transferability:** Need to assess applicability to specific organizational context

### Complementary Evidence Needs
**Scientific evidence alone is insufficient; requires:**
- Practitioner evidence for real-world implementation guidance
- Organizational evidence for context-specific feasibility
- Stakeholder evidence for acceptability and adaptation needs

## SUMMARY: Scientific Evidence Acquisition Completed

**Search Strategy:** Systematic keyword searches across 5 academic databases
**Selection Process:** Rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria applied; prioritized peer-reviewed quantitative studies
**AI Role:** Limited to search optimization and screening support; all critical decisions manual
**Final Selection:** 2 high-quality studies providing robust empirical evidence for X→Y relationship
**Quality Assurance:** Both studies from top-tier journals with clear effect size reporting

Scientific evidence provides strong quantitative foundation for psychological safety → decision quality/performance hypothesis. Evidence base is intentionally focused on highest-quality studies rather than exhaustive literature review.
