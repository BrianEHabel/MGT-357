# Scientific Evidence: Critical Appraisal (CAT Manager Analysis)

## CRITICAL APPRAISAL #1: Frazier Meta-Analysis

**Study:** Frazier et al. (2017) - Psychological Safety Meta-Analysis

### Study Design: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)
Meta-analysis = highest level of evidence. Synthesizes 136 independent studies with rigorous statistical methods.

### Sample Size: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
N=26,471 individuals. Exceptional statistical power. Results highly stable and generalizable.

### Measurement: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Multiple validated scales across studies. Edmondson's Psychological Safety Scale most common (gold standard).

### Bias Control: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)
Publication bias assessed (file drawer analysis). Some heterogeneity across studies but addressed through moderator analysis.

### Generalizability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Multiple industries, countries, team types. Engineering teams specifically represented. Findings robust across contexts.

### Overall Confidence: 90% (Very High)

### Decision: ✅ USE THIS EVIDENCE
This is gold-standard evidence. Large effect sizes, rigorous methodology, high generalizability. Strong support for X→Y hypothesis.

## CRITICAL APPRAISAL #2: Detert & Burris Longitudinal Study

**Study:** Detert & Burris (2007) - Voice Behavior and Decision Quality

### Study Design: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)
Longitudinal field study in real organizational setting. Multi-source data collection (employees + managers). Temporal separation between predictor and outcome measures.

### Sample Size: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)
Multiple units with adequate power for multi-level analysis. Sufficient to detect meaningful effects. Single organization limits generalizability.

### Measurement: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Voice behavior and decision quality measured with validated scales. Manager ratings supplemented with unit-level objective metrics.

### Bias Control: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)
Multi-source data reduces common method bias. Statistical controls for confounding variables. Longitudinal design strengthens causal inference.

### Generalizability: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)
Conducted in retail organization (different from engineering context). 17+ years old (workplace dynamics may have evolved). Voice mechanisms conceptually applicable across settings.

### Overall Confidence: 75% (High)

### Decision: ✅ USE THIS EVIDENCE
Rigorous design and rare direct measurement of decision quality. Generalizability moderate but voice dynamics likely similar across contexts.
