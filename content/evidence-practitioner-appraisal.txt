## OVERALL PRACTITIONER EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**Aggregate Confidence:** 80% (High)

**Strengths:**
✓ Google and McKinsey provide rigorous, large-scale validation  
✓ HBR/Edmondson bridges theory and practice authoritatively  
✓ Direct interviews confirm engineering-specific applicability  
✓ Convergent evidence across multiple independent sources  

**Limitations:**
⚠ Direct interviews limited to 2 practitioners (small sample)  
⚠ Google context (high resources) may not fully generalize  
⚠ Some retrospective self-report (vs. prospective measurement)  

**Decision:** STRONG SUPPORT FOR HYPOTHESIS AND INTERVENTIONS  
Practitioner evidence strongly validates both the problem (psychological safety deficits in teams) and the solution (structured dissent interventions). Combination of rigorous industry research + frontline experience provides high confidence.
