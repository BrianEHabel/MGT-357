SUCCESS CRITERIA: GROUPTHINK IN ORGANIZATIONAL DECISION-MAKING

Overview

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing groupthink, this framework defines specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria. These criteria link directly to the organization's objectives of improving decision quality, enhancing innovation, and fostering psychological safety.

SMART Success Criteria

1. Decision Quality Improvement
Specific: Improve the quality of strategic and operational decisions made by management teams.
Measurable: 25% improvement in decision quality scores from post-decision review surveys.
Achievable: Supported by research indicating structured decision processes can raise outcomes by 20–30%.
Relevant: Directly mitigates groupthink's effect on poor-quality decisions.
Time-bound: Achieve measurable improvement within 6 months, sustain over 12 months.

2. Innovation and Alternative Generation
Specific: Increase the number of alternative solutions considered before decisions.
Measurable: 50% increase in documented alternatives per decision (from 2–3 to 4–5).
Achievable: Structured brainstorming and devil's advocate sessions can reliably expand options.
Relevant: Counteracts groupthink's suppression of creative solutions.
Time-bound: Observable improvement within 3 months of intervention rollout.

3. Psychological Safety Enhancement
Specific: Improve employees' comfort expressing dissenting opinions.
Measurable: 30% improvement in psychological safety scores (Edmondson Scale).
Achievable: Research shows structured feedback and leadership modeling can raise scores by 25–35%.
Relevant: Builds the foundation for sustained reduction of groupthink.
Time-bound: Quarterly improvements expected within a 12-month horizon.
