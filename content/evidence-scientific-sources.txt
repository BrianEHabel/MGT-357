## STUDY 1: Meta-Analysis - Frazier et al. (2017)

**Full Citation:**
Frazier, M. L., Fainshmidt, S., Klinger, R. L., Pezeshkan, A., & Vracheva, V. (2017). Psychological safety: A meta-analytic review and extension. Personnel Psychology, 70(1), 113-165.

**Study Design:** Meta-analysis of psychological safety research

**Sample Size:** 136 independent studies; 26,471 individuals across multiple contexts

**Key Findings:**
• Psychological safety → Team learning behavior (r = 0.43, large effect)
• Psychological safety → Team performance (r = 0.44, large effect)
• Psychological safety → Information sharing (r = 0.51, very large effect)
• Psychological safety → Voice behavior (r = 0.35, moderate-large effect)

**Effect Size Interpretation:**
r = 0.44 explains approximately 19% of variance in team performance. This is a LARGE, practically significant effect in organizational research.

**Methodological Strengths:**
✓ Very large sample (N=26,471)
✓ Rigorous meta-analytic procedures
✓ Publication bias checks conducted
✓ Moderator analyses (context, measurement, etc.)
✓ Longitudinal studies included (strengthens causal inference)

**Relevance to Hypothesis:**
Directly validates X→Y relationship: Psychological safety (X) → Team performance/decision quality (Y). Effect size is large and robust across contexts including engineering teams.

**Quality Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent - Meta-analysis in top-tier journal)

## STUDY 2: Longitudinal Field Study - Detert & Burris (2007)

**Full Citation:**
Detert, J. R., & Burris, E. R. (2007). Leadership behavior and employee voice: Is the door really open? Academy of Management Journal, 50(4), 869-884.

**Study Design:** Multi-wave longitudinal field study with multi-source data

**Key Findings:**
• Employee voice behavior → Decision quality (significant positive relationship)
• Leader openness moderates the voice-performance link
• Temporal separation between measures reduces common method bias
• Multi-level analysis (employees nested within organizational units)

**Methodological Strengths:**
✓ Longitudinal design strengthens causal inference
✓ Multi-source data (employee reports + manager ratings)
✓ Rare direct measurement of "decision quality" as outcome
✓ Objective unit-level metrics supplement subjective ratings

**Relevance to Hypothesis:**
Validates mechanism (M): Voice/dissent behavior directly improves decision quality. Demonstrates that psychological safety enables voice, which translates to measurable performance outcomes. Leader behavior identified as critical moderator.

**Quality Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent - Premier journal, rigorous design)
